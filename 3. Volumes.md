```cmd
mkdir website
cd website
touch index.html
vim index.html (write some html)
docker run --name website -v $(pwd):/usr/share/nginx/html -d -p 8000:80 nginx:latest
```
Go to localhost:8000, you will see what you write.

```cmd
# run website container in interactive mode.
docker exec -it website bash
ls -la
cd usr/share/nginx/html
ls -la
```
You can see index.html in usr/share/nginx/html.
