# docker-and-kubernetes
## Preface
Recently, I watched freeCodeCamp.org youtube channel.The docker and kubernetes topic appeals to me.  
In that topic, I learned:
- creating docker images, running docker containers, docker volumes, container registry and docker architecture.   
- Kubernetes architecture, Kubernetes pods, services, config maps all the way to Kubernetes deployments.
